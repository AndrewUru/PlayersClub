**Riley Cross**, known to the world as **Phoenix Halo**, is the embodiment of a musical revolution in **Neo-Glam Rock**. With an androgynous allure and an electrifying presence, Phoenix Halo reinvents the glam rock aesthetic for the modern era. Hailing from Detroit, Michigan, Riley grew up surrounded by the raw grit of the city—a sound and attitude that now fuel his music.

His debut album, _Solar Flare_, is a kaleidoscope of soaring guitar riffs, explosive synths, and provocative lyrics. Tracks like _Ashes to Gold_ and _Starlight Rebellion_ showcase his fearless approach to blending genres, paying homage to the legends of glam while forging an identity uniquely his own.

On stage, Phoenix Halo is pure fire—dynamic costumes, dazzling light shows, and a vocal range that can both soothe and scorch. Off stage, Riley is a vocal advocate for self-expression and individuality, inspiring a generation to find their voice and burn brightly. **Phoenix Halo** is more than a rock star; he’s a movement, an icon for the bold and the unapologetic.
